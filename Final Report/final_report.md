## **Project Organization**

*   We have began this project by selecting means of communication which were crucial during these times. We have been using What's App and Zoom for both formal and informal communication. 
*   When it comes to the organization of the project and milestone planning we have been using Trello Boards for that. We have been using three different boards to keep track of different sections of the project organization.
*   1. Meeting Presence Tracker
*   2. Assignments Trackings
*   3. Backlog

*   We have decided to apply Pair Programming - an Agile Software Development Technique, because we believe that it is the best option during these times where we are limited to online communication only. Considering that there are four team members, by applying pair programming, we have eased up communication, by creating fewer misunderstandings and better progress. We have changed pairs during the project development, so that each member works with one another.

*   ### **Meeting Presence Tracker**

*   There were three different days of the week selected to be mandatory meetings.  We had predefined Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday or Sunday as mandatory meetings, while during the other days of the week we met in case it was needed. Meetings have been focused around the Group Assignments and Software Development. The main idea was discussing and understanding assignments to break them down into smaller tasks which were then assigned to either pairs or individuals.
*   We have tracked the presence of each teammate, topic of the meeting, as well as the time when the meeting began. 
*   At the beginning of each meeting we had Retrospective of the previous week, where we checked what was done compared to what was planned. Afterward, we would discuss what has to be completed in the upcoming week and we also assigned tasks to each team member.

*   ### **Assignments Trackings**

*   Within Assignment Tracking board, we have divided assignment into three categories:
*   1. Individual
*   2. Group
*   3. Bonus

*   For individual assignment, we have created a checklist, where each team member would check his own name after submitting a certain assignment. 
*   Group assignments had one list for Uncompleted and another for Completed.
*   The same approach has been used for both types of Bonus Assignments (Individual and Group).

*   Each assignment was declared as a part of a Project Milestone.

*   ### **Backlog**

*   Backlog was divided into for stages: "To-Do", "In Progress" and "Done". Each Item was initially added to the "To-Do" list, where team members would be assigned. After that, it is moved to the "In Progress" list. After the completion of the Item, person(s) that worked on it had to write a short description and move it to the "Done" list.

*   Each Item was a Task/Segment of the Software that we have been developing and also was part of one Project Milestone.
