#**How do we plan to collaborate?**

    - We plan to collaborate by working in pairs, and we will have regular online meetings via zoom or whatsapp call three times a week. We will use whatsapp for daily communication and meetings organisation, while we will keep track of progress and we communicate with TA's using Slack.

#**How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?**

    - We will synchronise who is assigned to do what during the call meetings and by checking Slack to make sure what is done.

#**How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?**

    - We will make sure that all team members have contributed to each part of the project, by changing responsibilities throughout the project.

#**What is our usual communication plan?**

    - The Group meetings are planned to be held three times per week after every Tuesday and Wednesday lecture and on Saturdays using Zoom or Skype. Daily communication between team members will take place instead on whatsapp if needed.

#**How will we solve conflicts?**

    - We will discuss the problems internally during the meetings and if we can't find any solution, we will contact TA for help.
