Group Assignment

In this assignment, you discuss in your group the following three questions:

    How do we plan to collaborate?

    - We plan to collaborate by working in pairs, and we will have regular online meetings via zoom or what's app call
    three times a week. We will use What's app for daily communication and meetings organization,
    while we will keep track of progress and we communicate with TA's using Slack.

    How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

    - We will synchornize who is assigned to do what during the call meetings and by checking Slack to make sure what
    is done.

    How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

    - We will make sure that all team members have contributed to each part of the project, by changing responsibilities
    throughout the project.

    What is our usual communication plan?

    - We will communicate using What's app daily, but we will have online calls every Tuesday and Thursday after the lecture
    and Saturday.

    How will we solve conflicts?

    - We will discuss the problems internally during the meetings and if we can't find the solution, we will contact TA
    for help.
