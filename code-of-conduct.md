Group Assignment

In this assignment, you discuss in your group the following three questions:

    How do we plan to collaborate?
    How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
    How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
    What is our usual communication plan?
    How will we solve conflicts?

Please discuss these items taking the current situation into consideration, i.e., how do you plan to collaborate when you need to avoid physical meetings.

Afterwards, you create a file named "code-of-conduct.md" in your group's repository (root folder, master branch), where you cover the results from your group discussions into clear instructions for the three topics mentioned above.
